precludes giving it a login environment with 'bash -l -c'...

Test what happens with other xlaunch's XML, if they contain attributes we don't know about

Rather than a fixed list of Xsessions, actually list what is installed

XDMCP finder?

automatic display number allocation

maintain history lists of remote hosts, commands run

Update cygwin-x-doc to mention xlaunch
